# spending_time

Visualizing time - a [D3](http://d3js.org/) view of time data.

Based on metmajer's [Zoomable Sunburst with Labels](http://bl.ocks.org/metmajer/5480307). 

## Getting started

Copy the files to a folder and open index.html in your browser. Firefox will run D3 locally.
	
## About this project

* index.html - the main application file
* .json files - the data for different time sets

## Resources
